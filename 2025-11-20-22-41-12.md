Disclaimer: I usually climb in north american gyms so maybe I'm just being a pampered baby.

This is the most bizarre gym (in a bad way) I have ever been to, and I try to go to a gym every time I travel.

They give the standard autobelay and boulder fall tests, but then (after paying to rent a rope) they just hand you rope and tell you you're good to lead climb/top rope without any belay test Officially "unsafe belaying" is not allowed but I did not see any staff actually paying attention to anyone and multiple instances of people doing stupid shit.

The gym is mostly lead climbing, all overhang, minimum grade is 5.10a. Grades felt pretty accurate. In both the safety video and in person they explicitly said that top roping in the lead area is NOT allowed, but we saw plenty of people doing this and when we asked the staff they said that it was fine as long as you stay clipped into the draws on the way up. I still have no idea what exactly they mean is not allowed (top roping without the draws in? Who would be insane enough to do that?). 

They have a small autobelay
