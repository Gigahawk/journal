Disclaimer: I usually climb in north american gyms so maybe I'm just being a pampered baby.

This is the most bizarre gym (in a bad way) I have ever been to, and I try to go to a gym every time I travel.

They give the standard autobelay and boulder fall tests, but then (after paying to rent a rope) they just hand you rope and tell you you're good to lead climb/top rope without any belay test Officially "unsafe belaying" is not allowed but I did not see any staff actually paying attention to anyone and multiple instances of people doing stupid shit like belaying miles away from the first clip. 

The gym is mostly lead climbing, all overhang, minimum grade is 5.10a. Grades felt pretty accurate. In both the safety video and in person they explicitly said that top roping in the lead area is NOT allowed, but we saw plenty of people doing this and when we asked the staff they said that it was fine as long as you stay clipped into the draws on the way up. I still have no idea what exactly they mean is not allowed (top roping without the draws in? Who would be insane enough to do that?). 

There are no mats in the lead area, if you deck it will be on sealed concrete. Note that outdoor (or maybe all non-climbing?) shoes are not allowed inside, so it also just really sucks for belayers. Idk how much it really helps with cleanliness because everyone just belays in their sweaty bare feet instead. 

They have an autobelay section with 5 autobelays. 4/5 had aftermarket carabiners without the standard swivel mount and a clear shrink wrap over where I assume they stitched on the aftermarket lanyard they used to attach the carabiners. The autobelays themselves are all mounted with really janky straps to some beams that seem unlikely to handle the 5000lbs MBS. 

Almost every anchor in use is also connected to the same beams despite there being permanent chain anchors mounted at the top of the wall (although all of the chains seem a tad short for the distance between bolts). 

Next to the autobelay section is a small top rope area with 4 ropes permanently set up. I guess to avoid testing whether climbers know how to tie a figure 8 they instead have a permanent figure 8 tied around the most banged up carabiners I have ever seen. Climbers are expected to just clip those to their belay loops instead of tying their own. To be fair they are a pair of double action lockers per rope but I have never seen any other gym do this.

Compared to the NA gyms I'm used to 450 TWD/person for a day pass + 180 TWD is not that unreasonable but it seems quite expensive compared to how cheap everything else has been in Taiwan, certainly way too expensive for how jank everything feels.
