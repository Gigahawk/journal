# Snowboard Setup

# Boards

Arbor Satori 2025 151cm.
Honestly slightly long and wide but it looks so sick and is so fun in powder.
Bought used for 350 CAD

[SELLING] Rossignol Frenemy 147cm.
Good length but too narrow cause its a womens board.
Might have been ok if I had small bindings?
Bought new for 250 CAD
