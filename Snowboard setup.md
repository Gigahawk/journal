# Snowboard setup

# Board

Arbor Satori 2025 151cm.
Bought used for 350 CAD
Honestly slightly too long and wide but it looks so sick and is so fun in powder.
Came with a transparent stomp pad in the middle I've been too lazy to replace

[SELLING] Rossignol Frenemy 2020 147cm.
Bought new for 250 CAD
Good length but too narrow cause its a womens board.
Might have been ok if I had small bindings?
Mounted Burton aluminum stud stomp pad. 

# Bindings

Step on Genesis binding (2022?) (2nd gen) Mens small

[OLD] Step on re:flex binding 2021 (1st gen) Men's Medium


Rear foot +6deg, nominal axial position, off centerline heelside
Front foot +18deg, - 1 axial position, off centerline heelside


## Mods

### Highback delete mod

### Highback locked up mod

Size 20 hose clamp (3/4"-1 3/4", 19-44mm)
There's about 1.5inch tail on the clamp could probably size down the clamp

Size 16 clamp works ok too, easiest to install with binding off the board


Heat shrink 3/8"-3/16" (10-5mm), 12-4AWG (size 3?) 

# Boots

TODO: document new DC boots

[OLD] Burton Photon Step On 2021 Men's 8.5

Foam stuffed into front where ankle meets shin.
Honestly not the right size, I'm probably closer to a mens 8 or 7.5. If I don't buy boots this season might try taping foam to the bottom of the fake strap thing
