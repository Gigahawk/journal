Ride lasso honestly good ankle for but a little soft
Pro is good but hard to tighten might be OK with time
Insano is surprisingly good,  liner straps go really deep super pog
Hera pro wide size W9 pretty OK heel lift quite small, but worse once in binding, slightly tight around sphere bone joint things at ankle. No liner lace is neat
Cadence W9.5 quite good, also tight around sphere bone, slightly worse inside binding, liner lace goes super low, maybe too low




Nidecker kita too stiff to crank ankle down, liner lace goes quite deep 

Bataleon mosh boa reallllly stiff hard to get into, still heel lift, colorwy is sick

Rome bodega just OK, still a little lift

Vans aura pro just OK, little lift, might be better with break in side boa is really hard to tighten

Burton Photon step on M8.5 2025 mildly better but will probably break in like shit
Supposedly a triple boa step on is coming out next year

Waverange and highshot definitely need to be size 8, but the ankle strap is actually not that comfortable. Really easy to overtighten and kind of biting when they flex. Highshot is not as stiff as I would have expected but its fine. Finding small step on used bindings is also basically impossible here. Might just go get supermatics sigh.

K2 Maysis M8 is alright, conda doesn't tighten down hard enough surprisingly, might be possible to stuff the conda with foam but at that point I might as well try stuffing more foam on my current boots.
Maysis M7.5 isn't really better and toebox is kinda small

Nidecker Altai is unremarkable but liner Velcro is awful, spiky side faces out easy to get cut
