Ride lasso honestly good ankle for but a little soft
Pro is good but hard to tighten might be OK with time
Insano is surprisingly good,  liner straps go really deep super pog


Nidecker kita too stiff to crank ankle down, liner lace goes quite deep 

Bataleon mosh boa reallllly stiff hard to get into, still heel lift, colorwy is sick

Rome bodega just OK, still a little lift
