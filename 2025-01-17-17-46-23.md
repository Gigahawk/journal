Ride lasso honestly good ankle for but a little soft
Pro is good but hard to tighten might be OK with time
Insano is surprisingly good,  liner straps go really deep super pog
Hera pro wide size W9 pretty OK heel lift quite small, but worse once in binding, slightly tight around sphere bone joint things at ankle. No liner lace is neat




Nidecker kita too stiff to crank ankle down, liner lace goes quite deep 

Bataleon mosh boa reallllly stiff hard to get into, still heel lift, colorwy is sick

Rome bodega just OK, still a little lift
