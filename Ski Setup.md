# Ski Setup

# Skis

Rossignol Pursuit 14x 152cm
Bought used for 180 CAD from Sports Junkies.
Heavy as shit. 


# Boots

Lange SX RTL 2020 (Mondo point 265, 306x102mm)
Bought used for 130 CAD from Sports Junkies.
Tbh not the right size. Good heel hold but toe box is a little too long/packed out. Feels too narrow in general. 


# Poles

Salomon Hacker Poles (I think 115cm?)
