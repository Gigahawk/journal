# Ski Setup

# Skis

Rossignol Pursuit 14x 2013 152cm
Bought used for 180 CAD from Sports Junkies.
Heavy as shit. 

DIN 5.5

Rossignol Experience RTL 2015 150cm
Bought used for 50 CAD from Winter Extreme 2025


# Boots

Lange SX RTL 2020 (Mondo point 265, 306x102mm)
Bought used for 130 CAD from Sports Junkies.
Tbh not the right size. Good heel hold but toe box is a little too long/packed out. Feels too narrow in general. 


# Poles

Salomon Hacker Poles (I think 115cm?)
