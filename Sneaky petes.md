# FOOD

# Sneaky Petes
BBQ chicken
I was really hungry so idk
Honestly super good

# Walles bistro
Milk tea
Honestly just OK, kinda too watery, like the tea forward taste tho

Salad is quite good

Kung pao chicken
Weirdly sweet but its still pretty good
Spicy is probably OK I got medium last time

Pan fried wonton
Pork n shrimp filling quite good texture n crisp, filling could be more flavorful but sauce makes it ok
