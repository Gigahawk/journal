# Mangos

Ataulfo - meh, kinda watery

Kent - ~very mid~ turns out they're alright. Originally thought they were bad because we put them in the fridge for too long

R2E2 - Good texture, but a little mild

Tommy atkins - supposedly tart with sweet notes and doesn't seem well liked

Keitt - supposedly good
