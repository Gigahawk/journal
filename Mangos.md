# Mangos

Ataulfo - meh, kinda watery

Kent - ~very mid~ turns out they're alright. Originally thought they were bad because we put them in the fridge for too long.
The costco ones are very mid???? Probably they're taken off the tree early and don't ripen properly? 


R2E2 - Good texture, but a little mild

Tommy atkins - supposedly tart with sweet notes and doesn't seem well liked

Keitt - supposedly good
