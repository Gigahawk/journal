# Supermatics old vs new

New buckle design, honestly not that big of a deal.
Can supposedly be replaced with new ones 
https://www.nidecker.com/products/ab-n004-a-lsr2-0-carb-ankle-bkle-2025 need to find out if they can be sourced in canada?

Its possible to jam the mechanism too far, supposedly this behavior has been improved on 2026 but I can't find the comment that mentioned this on reddit anymore, nor can I find any explanation of what's actually changed in the mechanism.

Pictures of the mechanism indicate that the new ratchet is beefier and has a feature to prevent overrotation. Should go to Pacific boarder and double check
